# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Kevin Reedy!

I'm an engineer from Chicago, currently working for [GitHub](https://github.com) as a Customer Success Architect. I also founded [RecRec](https://recrec.io), where I use technology to help build communities in recreation sports groups. I'm a founding board member of [DevOpsDays Chicago](https://devopsdays.org/events/2023-chicago/welcome/) and [The Illinois Shuffleboard Association](https://www.illinoisshuffleboard.org/).

For fun you'll find me Playing Shuffleboard (the kind you'd expect to see on a cruise ship), Cycling, and Cooking.
